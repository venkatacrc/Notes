        "##What is OOP\n",
        "Is to give precedence to **data** over function. This allows **Information hiding**, encapsulation and segregation of data behind well defined and stable interfaces. Also, hides design and implementation details. Information hiding is achieved by technique called **Encapsulation**. This makes code more maintainable, as rest of the code does not bother about the implementation details are defined. Another major advantage of using objects and encapsulating them into cohestive entities is it allows the reuse of object definitions by incremental refinement, called **Inheritance**. We can use Car as incremental refinement of Vehicle and we can start using Car wherever Vehicle can be used is called **Polymorphism**.\n",
