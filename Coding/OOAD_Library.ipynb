        "1. Each **patron** has one unique library card for as long as they are in the **system**.\n",
        "1. The **library** needs to know at least the *name, address, phone number, and library card number* for each patron.\n",
        "1. In addition, at any particular point in **time**, the library may need to know or to calculate the **items** a patron has `checked out`, `when they are due`, and any `outstanding overdue fines`.\n",
        "1. Children (*age* 12 and under) have a special restriction - they can check out five tems at a time.\n",
        "1. A patron can `check out` **books** or **audio/visual** materials.\n",
        "1. Books are checked out for three **weeks**, unless they are current best sellers, in which case the limit is two weeks.\n",
        "1. A/V materials may be checked out for two weeks.\n",
        "1. The overdue fine is ten cents per iterm per day, but cannot be higher than *the value* of the overdue item.\n",
        "1. The library also has **reference books** and **magazines**, which can't be checked out.\n",
        "1. A patron can `request` a book or A/V item that is not currently in.\n",
        "1. A patron can `renew` an item once (and only once), unless there is an outstanding request for the item, in which case the patron must `return` it.\n",
