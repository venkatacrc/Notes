However this **can never be done in practice**. In order to perfectly predict we have to know exactly what is going on, but we can't do that. We think the model in our minds the dice roll is random and each side is equally likely. So we can summarize the dice roll as I don't know what the answer is so I will assume to be random over set if all possible outcomes.\n",
