        "NP = class of all search problems (regardless of time required to solve)\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, $P\\subset NP$\n",

        "What is a search problem?\n",
        ">Roughly, a problem where we can efficiently verify solutions. Given a solution we can verify this is a solution in Polynomial time.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Formally, Search problem has the following input/output form:\n",
        "Given instance I (e.g., graph G) we are asked to find a solution if one exists and if no solution exists we output No.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Additional requirement: If we are given a solution S for instance I, then we can verify (i.e. check) that S is a solution to I in time Polynomial in |I|.\n",

        "So P=NP or P$\\neq$NP addresses whether or not\n",
        "Solving a problem(i.e., constructing a solution) is as easy as verifying a solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "if $P=NP$: means that if we can verify solutions efficiently then we can construct solutions efficiently. (e.g., verifying a proof is as hard as constructing a proof)\n",
